**# Space-Sustainability**

Objective:
The objective of the project is to ensure the long-term sustainability of space operations by preventing collisions between satellites and space debris. As the population of space debris continues to grow, there is an increasing risk to operational satellites. The primary goal is to develop a robust collision avoidance system that can protect our orbital assets and mitigate the risk of cascading collisions in space.

The main problems associated with satellite collisions and space debris are as follows:

Increasing Space Debris Population: Over the years, space debris has accumulated in Earth's orbit due to previous missions and incidents. This debris poses a constant threat to active satellites.
Risk to Operational Satellites: Collisions with space debris can lead to severe damage or complete loss of operational satellites, impacting communication, navigation, and Earth observation services.
Cascading Collisions: The collision of one satellite with space debris can generate additional fragments, increasing the risk of further collisions, thereby exacerbating the problem.
